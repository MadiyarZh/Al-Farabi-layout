                            <p>
                                The journal "Alpharabi" in its publication activities is guided by the principles of ethics enshrined in the international publication space, in particular, the Committee on Publication Ethics, COPE and the ethical code of the scientist, which is followed by the staff of the Institute of Philosophy, Political Science and Religious Studies of the СS MES RK.
                                <br><br>
                                Compliance with ethical principles is an important condition and factor that ensures the professional quality of a scientific journal. It creates an intellectual and psychological atmosphere of solidarity and respectful relations of trust and cooperation not only in the editorial staff, but also between all participants in the publication process.
                                <br><br>
                                The ethos of the journal's publication activity establishes the norms and principles of ethical behavior for editors, reviewers and authors, and also determines measures to identify conflicts of interest and unethical behavior. On its basis, there are instructions for the withdrawal (retraction), correction and refutation of the publication.
                                <br><br>
                                All parties involved in the preparation of materials for publication in the journal (authors, peer reviewers, members of the editorial board) abide the following principles of publication ethics:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The content of articles is assessed regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, ethnic origin, citizenship or political views of an author.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The editorial board has no right to disclose information about the material submitted for publication to anyone other than author and reviewers.
                                </li>

                            <p><strong>Publication ethics of the reviewer</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                The most important condition for an expert assessment of the work submitted for publication is objectivity, scientific nature and reasoning, which must be followed by the reviewer. The reviewer should evaluate the manuscript, regardless of personal bias and personal assessments of the author. Peer review plays a leading role in making a decision on the issue of publication, since the reviewer must reasonably and competently justify the comments made and the decision to accept or reject the manuscript.
                                <br><br>
                                The reviewer's expert assessment is based on strict adherence to the principles of scientific objectivity, the contribution of the published work to the scientific space of the discussed problems, its novelty, relevance, theoretical and scientific-practical significance of the provisions put forward in the presented work.
                                <br><br>
                                The reviewer is obliged to submit an opinion on the evaluation of the publication in a timely manner and within the time frame established by the editorial board. If the terms of preparation of the review cannot be met, then the reviewer must inform the editor about it. He must do the same if he believes that his qualifications are not enough to carry out expert work.
                                <br><br>
                                The principle of confidentiality must be strictly observed by the reviewer. The reviewer cannot discuss it with third parties, he has the right to do this only after receiving the written permission of the author (s) or scientific editor. He also cannot use the ideas and solutions of the peer-reviewed work for personal purposes.
                                <br><br>
                                When evaluating the submitted work, the reviewer must proceed from the criteria for evaluating the manuscript, which were developed by the editorial board and noted in the "Memo to the reviewer". They include criteria of relevance, novelty, completeness and confirmation of sources, structure, style and language of the article presentation, for each of which the reviewer evaluates the manuscript and makes an informed decision on its publication or rejection.
                                <br><br>
                                If the reviewer, on the basis of observing the principles of scientific and objectivity, believes that the manuscript contains false data, incorrect borrowings, falsified facts and materials, false authorship, copyright infringement, manipulation of primary sources and scientific literature, appeal to agency services, publication in other publications before submission of the manuscript to the journal "Al-Farabi", then he should not give a positive opinion on the manuscript and admit it to publication.
                                <br><br>
                                The reviewer's assessment should contribute to an increase in the level of scientific publications of the journal and contribute to an increase in the professional significance of the publication in the market of scientific products. If a violation of the principles of not only scientific research, but also publication ethics is found, the reviewer should not recommend the manuscript for publication and inform the editorial board of the journal about it.

                            <p><strong>Conflict of interest</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                A conflict of interest is a situation that arises due to personal, financial, professional interests and conditions that affect the publication activities of the author (s).
                                <br><br>
                                The conflict can influence the judgments and decisions of reviewers, members of the editorial board regarding the publication of the manuscript. The editor-in-chief in the work of all participants in publication activities must require the disclosure of a conflict of interest.
                                <br><br>
                                When submitting a manuscript for consideration, the author (s) may indicate in the Covering Letter scientists who, in their opinion, are in a conflict of interest and therefore cannot objectively evaluate the manuscript.
                                <br><br>
                                Members of the editorial board should refuse to consider the manuscript if there is any conflict of interest with the author (s) of the article. Everyone who is involved in the passage of the article for publication should report a potential conflict of interest that may somehow affect the decision of the editorial board.
                                <br><br>
                                However, the presence of a conflict of interest does not mean that the manuscript cannot be rejected.
                                <br><br>
                                In the event of a conflict of interest, the executive editor must notify the scientific editor of this, after which the review and review of the manuscript is entrusted to another editor / reviewer. It is important for all stakeholders to avoid the emergence of a conflict of interest and use all the levers and mechanisms to eliminate it.
